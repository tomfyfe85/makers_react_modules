Challenge 07_Challenge
Update your gig application so that the Gig component 
doesn't have any state of its own. Instead, "lift" the
state of the gigs into a parent component. Write some
code so that instead of listing all gigs together, 
"favourited" gigs are above other gigs.

New component - AllGigs

AllGigs component will handle the state

AllGigs will handle gig components
gigs start as false

in AllGigs, jsx maps out <Gig/>'s


08_exercise 2
Add a phone number field to the form above. 
Edit the handler function so that only numbers are 
allowed in the input, and letters are removed.

- add the field
- add state
- save event.target as a variable
- if var === 0-9 setState(var)



create AllGigs component
create Bands component to house bands data
import Bands into all gigs
(test we can map Gig components using Band data)

set up useState in AllGigs
Band data get saved as state {bands, setBands}
Pass band state as props to each gig component

Take bands props and loop through
